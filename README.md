# PesticideProject
Project I started working on in January of 2021, still in progress. The idea is to create a simple calculator for pesticide workers (ex. exterminators) to use. 
Example calculations it provides includes calculating volume of a particular building, calculating how much spray mix (pesticide) is needed for a building of such volume, etc. 
The calculations are actually very easy but the idea is to make it simple and user friendly.
